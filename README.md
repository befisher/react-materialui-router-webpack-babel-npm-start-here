## Start a Single-page Application From HERE

Then the installation of node_modules things and further configurations are needed, which could be tedious and should be simplified. Here you can start a SPA right from here, fast and easy. Following shows how.

```bash
# Clone this project to a specific folder.
git clone https://github.com/zhanbei/react-materialui-router-webpack-babel-npm-start-here Your-Front-end-Project-Name

# Update the package.json to fit your need.
cd Your-Front-end-Project-Name && npm init

# Install required modules
npm install
```

It is done and start adding components and building your own SPA now! {>;}

## Get Started With *React*, *MaterialUI*, *ReactRouter*, *Webpack*, *Babel*, and *NPM*

[React][home-reactjs-org] is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is impressive and powerful(*personal opinion* :), but also complex. It is not that easy to get started with React and related libraries, like *Material UI*, *Webpack*, and *Babel*. This repository is also a great place for you to practice and get started with *React*.

```bash
# Clone this project to a specific folder.
git clone https://github.com/zhanbei/react-materialui-router-webpack-babel-npm-start-here React101

# Install required modules
cd React101 && npm install

# Build the project.
# `dist/main.js` will be generated, after it is done.
npm build
```

**Open the `dist/index.html` file with your browser** to check it out and see what it looks like.

All set and ready for you, and start your trip to the world of React now! {>;}

*Having fun!*
